# flask_Playground
Just learning how to use flask. Thinking about turning this into a homepage that stores all the tools and apps I create.


Flask Workspace is within Previous_resources folder. Current workspace is flaskPlaygroundApp where I'm beginning to work with React and then incorporating past elements once I figure out how react works.
